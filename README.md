# 06-Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard that allows a user to check the weather outlook in multiple cities

### User Guide

When the site opens the user is presented with the weather dashboard; they can enter a city name in the search-bar. Upon either clicking, "Search," or hitting, "Enter," on their keyboard, the user is then presented with today's forecast including temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and the UV index. The UV index
changes color depending on severity: green for favorable, yellow for moderate, and red for severe.

Below today's forecast five cards appear showing the forecast for the next five days; this includes a weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind-speed.

If the user has previously searched for a city then it will appear in a list of previously-searched cities on page-load.  The user can click on a previously-searched city in order to search for that city's information again.  To bring up the list again the user merely has to click, "Refresh for Previous Searches," clearing the
current results and displaying the list. The user can also clear the list of previously searched cities by selecting, "Clear Search History".
